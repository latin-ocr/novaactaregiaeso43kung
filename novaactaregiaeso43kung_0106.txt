be dismissed. It is true that many authors regard the scaphocephalio
(161011111111 as a sign of degeneracy and that a not inconsiderable pro-
portion of scaphocephalic individuals is found to be psychically de—
ficient. There are„ however„ several cases knowm which prove that
even a pronouneed deformity of this kind does not exclude a high
intellectual and moral development. But the supposition that 811111]-
·[1ΕΝ110110’5 head was scaphocephalic seems 101· various reasons not
very probable. A wig from the 17th century was certainly able to
conceal a considerable deformity of the brainpan, but 35 1116 death-
mask in Fig. 7 shows, the scapl'locephalics of higher degree ordinarily
have 3 very characteristic 136131 type7 which does 1101 agree with the
pertraits 01 SWEDENBORG.

But there are other reasons which prove with greater cer-
tainty that the scaphocephalic XVellelose Square skuli cannot be

SWEDENBORG'S. In my above-cited acccmnt I have described and re-
produced 3. [1311 01 3 lower jawbone which was found in the coffin of

31] 111-11616 11] »The East London 0115611161» for March 9111, 1912, that the whole skeleton 11]

read the Proceedings at the examinatiou of Swssnmssona's 6011111, Upsala, May 29111, 1908, and
the analysis of the facts in my above cited account, 110 doubts can persist that 1116 6011111 15
511·Εῡε]11;10116’5 and that 1116 skeletal remains in its lower part still lying enveloped in the

11161115 of Hmmmnsu and foHmN referred to is easy 10 understand when one considers that
only the upper part of 1116 16111161] 601111] had been opened up 10 1908.

This article, as well as several others issued 111 1116 same newspaper for February
and March 11151, dealing with »The Mystery of the. Skull», make zealous efforts to vindicate
the Wellclose Square skull's being SwEDENssoac's, and to that end render 1116 conclusion of

single new 11161, but only a series of hypotheses without real grounds, and moreover contain
several mistakes aud perversions of facts, quite obvious to everyone acquainted with 1116
question, it 5661115 unnecessary 10 enter into a detailed reply. It will be enough to state that
the reproach that the Committee has not used l'or compar-ison with the skuli the pertrait of
8111311511130110 painted 111 1785 by J. Hmmmasn, falls before the circumstance that this picture,
in spite os repeated inquiries, has not been recovered, and sor the time being may be re-
garded 35 lost. For 1116 rest Ι refer to my above-cited paper, which contains 311 facts
