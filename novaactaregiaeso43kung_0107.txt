tion of the corresponding part of the skull. Now, on the contrary,
the cast of the skull from W ellclose Square with its atrophied alveolar
process shows that the 100111, and especially the canine7 and its neigh-
bours on the right 51110. 1111151 have been lost a long time before death,
whereas the condition of the lower jawbone from SwEDENBORe's coffin
with manifest remains of the canine and the bicuspids in its well pre-
served alveolar process on the right side indicates that they have been
used for chewing up to a period not very long before death, which
should have been impossible if 1110 opposite teeth in the upper jaw had
not been preserved up to about the same time.

Finally‚ I shall refer to the oft-quoted characterization of the
skull of SWEDENBORG by the sculptor FLAXMAN„ who examined it at the
house of Mr. TULK. An eminent and experienced sculptor is generally
not unacquainted with anatomy, and he must. in any case be endowed
with a fine sense of the normal forms of the human body. It is 1111110
impossible that such a man, if he had 111 1115 hands this abnormal,
scaphocephalic skull could say: »How beautiful the form! . . . Here
is 110 deficiencyl» And FLAXMAN's further declaration: »Whyg I should
almost take it for a female 1101111, were 11 1101 101· 1110 peculi-ar character

the skull in question. Everyone who is acquainted with the scxual
differences 01 human 1311111111, 1111151 admit that 11115 5111111 15 01 11 1100111011
masculine type„ and that if it in any point at all approachcs to the
female type³ it 15 ]”1151 111 regard to the forehead!

The fact-s now related seem fully to justify the conclusion that
the Wellclose Square skull is not Β11Ἐ1)ΕΝ110110’5ἢ and the results 010111·

With regard 10 1110 considerable 1111110 that a collector 01 curios

should be very much surprised if not more than one »genuinw 5111111

judging from the present case„ it will probably be fairly awkward to
find any real proofs countcrvailing 111050 011 which the opinion ex-
pressed in my account 15 based.
