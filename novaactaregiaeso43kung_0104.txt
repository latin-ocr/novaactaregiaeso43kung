The characteristies of the seaphoeephalie deformity are a ridge-
like vertex and (at least in the majority of cases] a more or less eom-
plete fusion of the parieta] bones With an alteration of the growth of
the skull‚ so that it becomes extraordinarily long and-marrow, often
with an overhanging front
and a prolonged baek' of
the head. Frequently one
finds also on the erown of
the skull a characteristic
roughness of the surfaee
and a little extension of
the fused parietals pro—
truding into an angle of
the frontal. (Compare Figs.

priinary causes several hy-
potheses have been ad—
vaneed Besides the old
theory that seaphoeephaly
is an atavistie malforma-
tion, opinions differ as to
whether it may be regarded
as an original derange-
ment of the earliest em—
bryonal development or as
due to ante-natal raehitis
or to hereditary syphilis.
Pronouneed scaphoeephaly
is av rare anoinaly: judging from the essay of BACKMAN (Uber die Sca-
plzocephalie, Anatomisehe Hefte, 1908), hardly a dozen erania are de-
scribed in the whole anatoinieal literature with a malformation of the
sanie degree as that of the skull now in question.

It is a Curious eoineidenee that the Anatomieal Institute of Up-
sala received a lew years ago a veritable parallel to the skull from
the shop in Wellelose Square. The seaphoeephalie skull of Upsala
(Figs. 3, 4 and G) has belonged to a dee-repit tin-smith⁷ who had suffered
from dementia ραναῖῃίιόα and died in a poor-house at Stoekhohn„ aged
50· years. Because of his peeuliar appearanee I proeured a death-mask
